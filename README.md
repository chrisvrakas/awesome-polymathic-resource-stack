> Below you'll find an ever-evolving list of 600+ hand-picked resources that shape my worldview and daily workflows.

## 🧠 PHILOSOPHY

Most resource lists are one-dimensional: privacy tools for paranoid nerds, business books for MBA types, or dev tools for coders. **This isn't that.**

**The future will belong to those non-obvious thinkers who use their wide-ranging powers of interdisciplinary exploration to see connections between multiple, seemingly unrelated domains.**

This stack reflects real-world workflows across:

* **Privacy & Security** (OpSec, encryption, anonymity, Bitcoin)
* **Business & Strategy** (entrepreneurship, marketing, persuasion)
* **Creative & Design** (graphic design, music production, writing)
* **Philosophy & Psychology** (how to think, not just what to think)
* **Hacking & Development** (from Linux basics to AI agents)
* **Culture & History** (true crime, biographies, underground narratives)

This list is my ever-evolving cognitive fingerprint—each item reflects personal experience, tested workflows, and hard-won knowledge. And I'm happy to share it with you.

**Philosophy:** Free knowledge. Open minds. Sovereign individuals.

## 📚 WHAT'S INSIDE

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| [💻 Software](#-software) | 137 tools | Privacy-first, open-source tools across 20 categories |
| [📖 Books](#-books) | 155 books | Essential reads across Bitcoin, cypherpunk, hacking & philosophy |
| [🎬 Movies](#-movies) | 62 films | Hacking culture, cartels, cult classics, and underground |
| [🎙️ Podcasts](#-podcasts) | 55 shows | Continuous learning across security, crypto, culture |
| [🔖 Bookmarks](#-bookmarks) | 223 resources | Curated web resources for privacy, OSINT, design |

---

## 🎯 WHO THIS IS FOR

**You should use this list if:**

* ✅ You value privacy but aren't dogmatic about it
* ✅ You want to learn across domains, not just specialize in one
* ✅ You prefer open-source tools but understand when proprietary makes sense
* ✅ You're building something that matters and need a battle-tested stack
* ✅ You're curious about the intersections: where hacking meets philosophy, where art meets encryption

**This list isn't for you if:**

* ❌ You want a purely ideological privacy setup (use PrivacyTools.io instead)
* ❌ You need hand-holding (I assume technical competence)
* ❌ You only work in one domain (specialists won't appreciate the range)

---

## 🛠️ HOW I CURATE

**My criteria:**

1. **Actually used** - I don't list tools I haven't battle-tested
2. **Polymathic range** - Covers privacy, creativity, business, and culture
3. **Practical over pure** - Real-world workflows over ideological purity
4. **Quality signal** - If it's here, it's worth your time

**I intentionally include:**

* FOSS alternatives alongside paid tools
* Privacy-focused options next to mainstream platforms
* Technical CLI tools with GUI applications
* Books from multiple contradictory philosophies

The goal isn't to prescribe a single path—it's to equip you with options across every domain.
